Spring Boot Web3 dApp
A modern Spring Boot decentralized application (dApp) that demonstrates real-world blockchain integration on Ethereum using Web3j. This project showcases token management, NFT handling, and on-chain voting, all through a clean and easy-to-use RESTful API.
ðŸš€ Project Overview
This dApp allows users to interact with Ethereum smart contracts in a simple, scalable way. It supports:
ERC-20 Token Management: View token balances for any Ethereum wallet. Perfect for DeFi dashboards and portfolio tracking.
ERC-721 NFT Handling: List NFTs owned by a wallet and mint new ones (demo-ready), showcasing the potential for digital collectibles and NFT marketplaces.
On-Chain Voting: Submit votes and fetch results from a blockchain-based voting contract, demonstrating transparent and tamper-proof governance.
ðŸŒŸ Key Features
Web3j Integration: Seamlessly connects to Ethereum nodes (Infura) for both read and write operations.
Spring Boot REST APIs: Easily consumable endpoints for token, NFT, and voting interactions.
Configurable & Extensible: Smart contract addresses, wallet keys, and network settings are fully configurable via application.properties.
Portfolio Ready: Ideal for showcasing blockchain development skills, Web3 integration, and backend API design.
ðŸ’¡ Why This Project?
